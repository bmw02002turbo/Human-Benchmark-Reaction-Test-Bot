# Human Benchmark Reaction Time Bot

A very simple Python bot for the Human Benchmark reaction time test using Selenium. The bot waits for the presence of the green element ".view-go". Once it is detected, the bot clicks the button. Please note that this was made for Firefox; if using Chrome please change webdriver.Firefox() to webdriver.Chrome().
